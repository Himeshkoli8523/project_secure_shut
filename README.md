How to Use
For Non-Technical Users:
Navigation:
Use the bottom navigation bar to switch between Home, Permissions, and Settings.
Grant Permissions:
Go to the Permissions screen by clicking on "Permissions" in the navigation bar.
Click on the permission blocks (Camera, Location, etc.) to allow or manage access.
Follow Instructions:
The app will guide you with prompts (e.g., dialogs) to help secure your device.
For Technical Users:
Architecture:
Built with Flutter, utilizing widgets for modularity.
Uses the permission_handler package to manage device permissions.
Code Structure:
Modular components:
MyBottomNavigationBar: A reusable widget for the bottom navigation bar.
AddPermissionScreen: A screen with a dynamic list of permissions.
UI designed with consistent padding, spacing, and theming.
Integrations:
Permission handling logic can be expanded with PermissionHandler for actions like request() and check() for each permission.
Next Steps
Non-Technical Roadmap:

Add functionality for managing secure contacts and pictures.
Introduce guides for users on granting specific permissions.
Technical Roadmap:

Implement permission-handling logic for each permission.
Build backend (if required) to manage security policies.
Integrate error-handling mechanisms for denied permissions.
